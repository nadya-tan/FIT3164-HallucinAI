This index is published by the Farm Credit Association Corporation with a 1990-92-95 base. If the ratio of this index to the Prices Paid Index (for farm inputs) exceeds 100%, it suggests that farm product prices are rising faster than farm input prices. Conversely, if the ratio is below 100%, it means farm input prices are escalating quicker than farm commodity prices.
