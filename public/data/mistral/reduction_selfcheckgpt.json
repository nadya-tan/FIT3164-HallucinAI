The impact of the emp can be extremely disruptive or deadly to electrical equipment and at higher energy levels it can cause damage to large structures such as bridges and aircraft structures. The investigation of emp effects is an important part of electromagnetic compatibility (emc) engineering.

They can disrupt electrical equipment, and at higher energy levels, they can damage large structures such as bridges and aircraft structures. EMPs can be caused by lightning strikes, nuclear explosions, solar flares, and high-powered lasers, among other sources. They can have devastating effects on electronic devices, causing them to malfunction or fail, and can also harm people who are exposed to them. EMPs have been used as a weapon in warfare, and have also been proposed"], "new_summary": " The passage discusses Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), a sudden burst of electromagnetic energy, which can originate from either natural or human-made sources. These pulses can take the form of magnetic, electric, or electromagnetic fields, or large alternating currents. EMP interfering with electrical equipment can be extremely destructive or even lethal, causing significant damage to infrastructure like bridges and aircraft structures in high-energy situations, similar to a lightning strike.

This is achieved by intentionally disrupting the inverse covariance distribution among various traits within a complex system, typically by manipulating the variance of one trait compared to others, with body size commonly being one parameter. The resulting scaling relationship is graphically represented by plotting the values of two traits against each other. Manipulation of this data can alter the intercept (o) and/or slope (m) of the relationship, producing new variants. These variants can then be analyzed for differences in performance or function. By performing sequential testing on each component of a trait suite, researchers can assess how each individual part contributes to the overall quality of a complex phenotype and the performance of the organism as a whole. This method enables comparison between different biological species with varying levels of performance by adjusting traits to make them comparable and examining their respective values.", "score_delta": -0.056124460536617946}, {"original": "the european union is committed to upholding human rights and sees this as a core and essential part of its role . as such the eu tries to protect and promote these rights within member states and in communication with non - citizens . the roma are one of the largest minority groups within the eu at over six million persons . despite their numbers they have faced a long history of systematic discrimination and social exclusion from within europe . reports on the treatment of the roma within europe have shown that they are one of the most vulnerable minorities and still fall significantly behind their european counterparts in regards to education , employment , access to health care and housing . the eu acknowledges that there are issues of human rights violations relating to the treatment and rights of the roma within the eu and have taken measures to encourage each member state to take action and work towards greater roma inclusions in the areas of health , housing , education and employment and non - discrimination at a political , police and social level .", "old_summaries": ["In summary, the European Union is committed to upholding human rights and sees this as a core and essential part of its role.
